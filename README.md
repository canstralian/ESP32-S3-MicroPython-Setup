# ESP32-S3 with CAM Module: Setting up MicroPython

This guide will walk you through the steps to install MicroPython on your ESP32-S3 board with a CAM module and run MicroPython scripts without needing an SD card.

## Requirements

1. **ESP32-S3 board with CAM module**
2. **USB cable**
3. **MicroPython firmware for ESP32-S3**
4. **esptool.py** (for flashing firmware)
5. **Thonny IDE** (for writing and uploading scripts)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Install esptool.py

You'll need `esptool.py` to flash the MicroPython firmware onto your ESP32-S3.

Install `esptool.py` using pip:

```sh
pip install esptool
```

### 2. Download MicroPython Firmware

Download the appropriate MicroPython firmware for the ESP32-S3 from the [MicroPython website](https://micropython.org/download/esp32/). Look for the latest `.bin` file specific to the ESP32-S3.

### 3. Flash MicroPython Firmware

1. **Connect the ESP32-S3 to your computer** using a USB cable.
2. **Put the ESP32-S3 into bootloader mode**:
   - Hold the `BOOT` button (sometimes labeled as `IO0` or `GPIO0`).
   - Press the `RESET` button and release it.
   - Release the `BOOT` button.

3. **Find the USB port of your ESP32-S3**:
   - On Windows: It will be a COM port like `COM3`.
   - On Linux/macOS: It will be something like `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0`.

4. **Use esptool.py to flash the firmware**:

```sh
esptool.py --chip esp32s3 --port <YOUR_PORT> --baud 460800 write_flash -z 0x1000 <path_to_your_micropython_firmware.bin>
```

Replace `<YOUR_PORT>` with your actual port (e.g., `COM3`, `/dev/ttyUSB0`), and `<path_to_your_micropython_firmware.bin>` with the path to the downloaded MicroPython firmware.

### 4. Verify the Flash

1. Open a serial terminal program like PuTTY, Tera Term, or the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE.
2. Connect to the same port at a baud rate of `115200`.
3. You should see the MicroPython REPL prompt (`>>>`).

### 5. Write and Upload MicroPython Scripts

Use Thonny IDE for an easy way to write and upload your MicroPython scripts.

1. **Download and Install Thonny** from [thonny.org](https://thonny.org/).
2. **Open Thonny** and go to `Tools` > `Options` > `Interpreter`.
3. Set the interpreter to `MicroPython (ESP32)`.
4. Set the port to your ESP32-S3â€™s port.
5. Write your MicroPython script in Thonny.
6. Click the **Run** button (green play button) to upload and execute your script on the ESP32-S3.

### Example Script

Here's a simple script to test your setup:

```python
import machine
import time

led = machine.Pin(2, machine.Pin.OUT)

while True:
    led.on()
    time.sleep(1)
    led.off()
    time.sleep(1)
```

This script will blink the built-in LED on the ESP32-S3.

## Summary

By following these steps, you can flash MicroPython onto your ESP32-S3 and run scripts without needing an SD card. The Thonny IDE makes it simple to write and upload scripts, providing a user-friendly environment for MicroPython development on your ESP32-S3.
